<h4>About</h4>
<p class="question">What is this page for?</p>
<p class="answer">It provides a way to download your EVE Online character's market transaction in CSV format, both in the current and the "legacy" <i>gestalt</i> (as in the days of the now deprecated XML API). It also offers a very specialised way of retrieving contract data (single item sells from public contracts - the kind you might use to sell researched blueprints). While you're at it, you can look at some pretty graphs.</p>

<p class="question">But why?</p>
<p class="answer">Back in the days of the XML API I was using its endpoints very extensively to monitor my market transactions and was sitting on a huge stash of market data reaching back years. When the switch from the XML API to ESI Swagger API happened I had the options to either discontinue my past diligence or find a way to deal with the new challenge, figure out how to make the (more complex) ESI API work and how to transform its new outputs into a form that I could easily pipe into my existing data.</p>

<p class="question">Why R?</p>
<p class="answer">R was known to me as being good for data acquisition and transformation, and since I already had some practice in it, it seemed the right choice. I also  had been wanting to try out the Shiny package for quite some time, so basically it is a "two birds one stone" story.</p>

<p class="question">What is EVE?</p>
<p class="answer">EVE is a MMO (massive multiplayer online) game from CCP Games. It is set in humanity's distant future among the stars and is one of the few true and oldest sandbox games still online (release 2003).<br><br> 
It has a reputation of being continually taken very seriously by its players, featuring ruthless leaders of alliances of tens of thousands of players, cut-throat diplomacy, back room deals, intricate espionage, gigantic space battles <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/28/4565558/eve-online-biggest-space-battle-in-history">that puzzle the news for their destruction of wealth</a> and a living virtual economy that <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5057849/real-economist-studies-virtual-economy-in-eve-online">economists keep writing papers</a> about (this is how I learned about it, too). A historian wrote <a href="https://www.empiresofeve.com/">a book about its empires</a> of the first decade. Plus the regular confusion if this is actually still a game, a lifestyle, "real" or a cult depends on the person you ask.<br>
Oh, and did I mention its <a href="http://3rdpartyeve.net/">third party tool development community</a> because CCP is so awesome to make basically every ingame data accesible via an API?</p>
<hr>
<p class="question">Let's get to the real question: Is this a honeypot?</p>
<p class="answer">No. You can look up the code of the app on <a href="https://github.com/LittleGravitas/EVEwalletTransactions">my github repo</a>. But it could be one, and being paranoid about this shows you have already understood EVE's nature.<br><br>
How can you stop it from being able to pull data? See all third party applications that you gave permissions to <a href="https://community.eveonline.com/support/third-party-applications/">on this page</a>. Look for "RShiny Wallet_cloud". Then revoke permissions.<br><br>
Are you too paranoid to use it? You can run a local version of the app! Just check it out from my github repo mentioned above.

<p class="question">What is Shiny?</p>
<p class="answer">It's a package for R and a framework for building interactive web apps. It makes pretty, open source dashboard applications.
</p>
<hr>
<p class="question">Who are you?</p>
<p class="answer">I am <a href="https://evewho.com/pilot/Zyl+Kassad">Zyl Kassad</a>, retired from EVE. I might still receive ingame messages via EVEMon - one never really, really retires from EVE, I guess.
