<p class="question">What is EVE?</p>
<p class="answer">EVE is a MMO (massive multiplayer online) game from CCP Games. It is set in humanity's distant future among the stars and is one of the few true and oldest sandbox games still online (release 2003). 
It has a reputation of being continually taken very seriously by its players, featuring ruthless leaders of alliances of tens of thousands of players, cut-throat diplomacy, back room deals, intricate espionage, gigantic space battles <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/28/4565558/eve-online-biggest-space-battle-in-history">that puzzle the news for their destruction of wealth</a> and a living virtual economy that <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5057849/real-economist-studies-virtual-economy-in-eve-online">economists keep writing papers</a> about. A historian wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Empires-EVE-History-Great-Online/dp/0990972402">a book about its empires</a> of the first decade. Plus the regular confusion if this is actually still a game.</br>
Oh, and did I mention its <a href="http://3rdpartyeve.net/">third party tool development community</a> because CCP is so awesome to make basically every ingame data accesible via an API?</p>

<p class="question">Let's get to the real question: Is this a honeypot?</p>
<p class="answer">No. You can look up the code of the app on <a href="https://github.com/LittleGravitas/EVEwalletTransactions">my github repo</a>. But this doesn't mean much, it could still easily be a honeypot, primarily because you allow the application to keep pulling data from your account via the refresh token.<br><br>
How can you stop it from being able to pull data? See all third party applications that you gave permissions to <a href="https://community.eveonline.com/support/third-party-applications/">on this page</a>. Look for "RShiny Wallet_cloud". Then revoke permissions.<br><br>
Should you be this paranoid? Depends :) If you are a small fish marketeer, who would care about your transactions? Seriously. I don't care from what margins you make a profit. If you are a big trillionaire and your upcoming market manipulations would be visible in the data? Maybe better run a local version of the app.
